# GTA-Online-Solo-Session-Creator
Creates a solo public session, so you can invite your friends, do supplies, etc..

**Important: You will need .NET Core Runtime to run the program. Download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).**

## How it works:
It freezes your game for some seconds, so you can disconnect from your current lobby and get into a new empty lobby.

There, you can invite your friends and play without modders, annoying players, etc..

## How to use:
- Download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/iklevente/GTA-Online-Solo-Session-Creator/releases/latest) page
- Start GTA Online
- Start the program and press Activate button or Ctrl + F10 in-game
- Wait until done
- Enjoy your new public solo session
- Invite your friends

Keep in mind, that players can still join to your new solo session. In that case you can Activate the program again.

Just leave it in the background and press Ctrl + F10, if that happens.
